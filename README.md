## Project Report

### Reflection

The iteration was not terribly difficult, but it felt really nice to explore the Godot Engine for the first time. I love that the built in objects in Godot have -
their own visual representation inside of the node tab. I find this really intuitive and helpful, specifically for devs who are just getting started. I am also
incredibly impressed with how smooth and easy it is to use the sprite animation system. It is so quick and easy to set up animated characters and I am a huge fan.
I think the one thing that I find strange about Godot is how every object exists as a scene, not too sure how I feel about that one.
